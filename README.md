# Scratch Commenter Plus "Hack" Scratch using Javascript Console or Addon Extension!

**Scratch Commenter Plus** is a JavaScript tool that enhances the commenting experience on Scratch by adding additional input fields for changing the parent comment ID, the commentee ID and the amount of comments you post. It also displays the comment ID and commentee ID for each comment.

## **Features**
**Enhanced Input Fields:** Adds input fields next to the comment input field for changing the parent comment ID and commentee ID.
Comment ID Display: Displays the comment ID for each comment.<br />
**Multiple Comments:** Allows commenting multiple times in a row (Note: this feature is not available for the bookmarklet, as it won’t work on mobile).<br />
**User-Friendly:** Easy to use and integrate.<br />
## **Javascript**<br />
To use Scratch Commenter Plus, follow these steps: <br />

**1. Open the JavaScript Console:** <br />
Press F12 or Ctrl+Shift+J (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Opt+J (Mac) to open the console. <br />
Navigate to the “Console” tab.<br />
**2. Run the Script:**<br />
Copy and paste the contents of script.js into the console and press Enter. <br />
## **Mobile Installation**<br />
**1. Create a Bookmark:** <br />
Copy the contents of bookmarklet.js.<br />
Create a new bookmark and paste the code into the URL field.<br />
**2. Use the Bookmark:** <br />
Open the bookmark from your address bar whenever you want to use Scratch Commenter Plus.
## **Extension**<br />
**Download and install Extension:** <br />
Go to releases, then download Scratch Commenter Plus zip<br />
After that go to "chrome://extensions" or whatever url your browser uses, extract the zip, and load the unpacked folder inside of the other folder.<br />
For this you may have to enable developer mode if you havent already, typically there's an obvious setting for it but if you need help, Google.<br />
## **Usage** <br />
**Reply to a Comment:** <br />
Paste the comment ID of the comment you would like to reply to. Leave blank if you don’t want to reply. <br />
**Mention a User:** <br />
Paste the user ID of the user you want to mention in your comment in the commentee ID field. Leave blank if you don’t want to mention anyone. <br />
**Post Multiple Times:** <br />
Enter the number of comments you would like to post into the Amount box, then click outside of the box and wait for it to load. Note: large numbers will cause it to take a while to load or it may crash.

Scratch is a high-level, block-based visual programming language and website aimed primarily at children as an educational tool, with a target audience of ages 8 to 16.[8] Users on the site can create projects on the website using a block-like interface. Scratch was conceived and designed through collaborative National Science Foundation grants awarded to Mitchel Resnick and Yasmin Kafai.[9] Scratch is developed by the MIT Media Lab and has been translated into 70+ languages, being used in most parts of the world.[10] Scratch is taught and used in after-school centers, schools, and colleges, as well as other public knowledge institutions. As of 15 February 2023, community statistics on the language's official website show more than 123 million projects shared by over 103 million users, and more than 95 million monthly website visits.[10] Overall, over 1 billion total projects ever created (including unshared projects), exceeding their 1,000,000,000th project in April 2024.
Scratch takes its name from a technique used by disk jockeys called "scratching", where vinyl records are clipped together and manipulated on a turntable to produce different sound effects and music. Like scratching, the website lets users mix together different media (including graphics, sound, and other programs) in creative ways by creating and "remixing" projects, like video games, animations, music, and simulations.[11][12]
The Scratch interface is divided into three main sections: a stage area, block palette, and a coding area to place and arrange the blocks into scripts that can be run by pressing the green flag or clicking on the code itself. Users may also create their own code blocks, which will appear in the "My Blocks" section.
The stage area features the results (e.g., animations, turtle graphics, either in a small or normal size, with a full-screen option also available) and all sprites' thumbnails being listed in the bottom area. The stage uses x and y coordinates, with 0,0 being the stage center.[13]
Users of Scratch are called "Scratchers". Scratchers have the capability to share their projects and receive feedback. Projects can be uploaded directly from the development environment to the Scratch website and any member of the community can view and download the full source code to study or to remix into new projects.[27][28] Scratchers can also create project studios, comment, favorite, and "love" others' projects, follow other members to see their projects and activity, and share ideas. Projects range from games and animations to practical tools. Additionally, to encourage the creation and sharing amongst users, the website frequently establishes "Scratch Design Studio" challenges.[29]
