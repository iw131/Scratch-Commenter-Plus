**Scratch Commenter Plus** is a JavaScript tool that enhances the commenting experience on Scratch by adding additional input fields for changing the parent comment ID, the commentee ID and the amount of comments you post. It also displays the comment ID and commentee ID for each comment.

## **Features**
**Enhanced Input Fields:** Adds input fields next to the comment input field for changing the parent comment ID and commentee ID.
Comment ID Display: Displays the comment ID for each comment.<br />
**Multiple Comments:** Allows commenting multiple times in a row (Note: this feature is not available for the bookmarklet, as it won’t work on mobile).<br />
**User-Friendly:** Easy to use and integrate.<br />
## **Installation**<br />
To use Scratch Commenter Plus, follow these steps: <br />

**1. Open the JavaScript Console:** <br />
Press F12 or Ctrl+Shift+J (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Opt+J (Mac) to open the console. <br />

## **Mobile Installation**<br />
